[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)

Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

[Pre-Chorus]
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Intro]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Verse 1]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Verse 2]
How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Outro]
Power, greed
Money, Molly, weed
Percs, Xannys, lean, fame
And the strongest drug of them all
And the strongest drug of them all
Love

<song_end>

[Intro]
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math
[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres

[Bridge]
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'...

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
[Verse 2]
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die
Uno dos

Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil
It left so many R.I.P. 
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, yeah, uh

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole]
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you’re gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yеah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Bright lights pass me in the city, it’s emеrgency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame of sin and cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up in hell and poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollow me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me
See upcoming rap shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
It left so many R.I.P. 
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh, yeah

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole]
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you’re gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Too much money to count, what’s the amount? Check never bounce
I gotta pay a nigga to add it up
Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin’ up
Stackin' up, you're reachin' out, actin’ up

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Making five a month, that's regular
Nigga playing with us, that's a negative
Go back to start, that's never
I'm a boss, my closet leather
Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever
Told my twin this shit get better
These niggas done slipped, let me ahead of 'em
Got my feet up, I paid seventy bands to have sex on the jet
I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense
I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it
All this money coming in, it drive me crazy not to show it
I'll be crazy if I blow it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Pride is the Devil, uh
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
And it left so many R.I.P. 
Pride is the Devil
I think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, uh
